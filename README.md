# User-Registration-and-Login-System-with-Spring-Boot-and-React

This open-source project demonstrates the implementation of a secure user registration and login system built with Spring Boot and React. The goal of this project is to provide a robust foundation for user authentication in web applications.

## Features:

User Registration: Users can create new accounts by providing their email address and a secure password. Account validation is performed to ensure unique email addresses and strong passwords.

User Login: Registered users can securely log in to the application using their email and password.

Password Hashing: Passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database using bcrypt, ensuring data security.

JWT Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for session management and user authentication. They provide a stateless and secure way to authenticate users.

Responsive User Interface: The React frontend provides a user-friendly and responsive interface for registration and login.

Session Management: The application includes session management to keep users logged in, with options for session expiration and auto-logout.
